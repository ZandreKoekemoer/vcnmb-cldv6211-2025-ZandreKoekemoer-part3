# Features Added in Part 3: Filtering
In Part 3, advanced filtering was added to make the application more useful and user-friendly.

# 1. Filter Events by Event Type
On the events page, users can select a category (like Wedding, Conference, etc.) to view only those types of events.

This helps users quickly narrow down what theyâ€™re looking for.

# 2. Filter Bookings by Date Range
Users can view bookings between specific start and end dates.

This was done using LINQ queries and improves how bookings are managed and viewed.

# 3. Filter Venues by Availability
A toggle lets users view only available venues.
